# Point Cloud to Video Projection with ICP Registration

This repository contains a MATLAB script for projecting 3D points registered with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm onto a video sequence. This technique is commonly used in Augmented Reality (AR) applications to overlay virtual objects onto real-world scenes.

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that allows the overlaying of digital content onto the real world. In AR applications, a camera captures a real-world scene, and computer algorithms analyze the scene to determine the camera's position and orientation relative to the objects in the scene. This information is used to overlay virtual objects onto the real-world scene, creating the illusion that the virtual objects are part of the real world.

## ICP Registration

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is an algorithm used to register 3D point clouds obtained from different sensors, such as LIDAR or RGB-D cameras. The algorithm iteratively estimates the transformation that aligns the points in one cloud with the points in the other cloud by minimizing the distance between corresponding points.

## Point Cloud to Video Projection

The script in this repository demonstrates how to project a 3D point cloud onto a video sequence using ICP registration. The script first loads the 3D point cloud and the video sequence. It then applies ICP registration to register the point cloud to the video frame, and projects the registered point cloud onto the video frame.

The result is a video sequence where the virtual objects are overlaid onto the real-world scene. This technique can be used in various AR applications, such as gaming, advertising, and education.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, this repository provides a MATLAB script for projecting 3D points registered with ICP onto a video sequence. This technique is a crucial step in Augmented Reality applications and can be used in various fields.
